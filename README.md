I finished the lab completing all the work tickets using  "pretend conversations" jumping from the Admin and the ticket owners. I was exposed to a lot of new technology and software that I previously wasn't aware of. I enjoyed working on this lab I performed this Lab multiple times to get more familiar with navigating thru the environment.
